params hash -
 When a user submits a form,
 it is the params hash that contains
 all the input data.


 1. we'll be able to initialize a new instance of Post,
 2. grab those input values from params,
 3. assign them the post instance attributes and
 4. save the instance to our database.


*****Rails tries to map each
controller action directly to a template.*******
